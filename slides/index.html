                        Today we are in the middle of a triple planetary crisis. In addition to climate change, biodiversity is threatened as species are going extinct at an alarming pace and finally contaminants from human activities are giving rise to increased negative effects in the environment. Shipping contributes negatively to the development with respect to all these three topics.

                        International shipping is considered the backbone of global trade and more than 80% of all goods are at some point transported by ship.  At the same time, shipping is responsible for some 3% of the global carbon dioxide emissions, and when discussing the environmental pressures and impacts of shipping, there is often a rather narrow focus on greenhouse gas emissions. Of course this is very important, and the International Maritime Organization, the IMO, has set out an ambitious plan to decarbonize the maritime industry.

                        However, there are other types of pressures from shipping, with direct, detrimental effects on the marine environment, and thereby being at least of equal importance to mitigate. Today we will have a look at the environmental pressures and impacts that a container ship is giving rise to while carrying our goods across the ocean.
                        Starting to the left, even ships at anchor are giving rise to pressures, not only from the scouring of the seafloor, but also significant underwater noise when deploying and retrieving the anchor. During <b>anchorage</b> many of the onboard systems are still running, implying that there will be, for example, exhaust emissions, also from a ship at anchor.
                        If then moving on to a ship moving through the water, we have the problem with <b>ship strikes</b>, that is collisions with marine megafauna. In many areas, the major shipping lanes overlap with whale migration routes, increasing the risk of collisions.
                        Smaller organisms colonizing the hull, <b>biofouling</b>, is a severe problem that both may spread alien species and increase resistance through the water and thereby fuel consumption. Even a few millimeters of growth on the hull may give rise to tens of percents of increased fuel consumption. Hence, it is essential to try to minimize the problem of hull growth, but it is unfortunate that most ships today are painted with toxic <b>antifouling</b> paints.
                        In the Baltic Sea, for example, antifouling paints constitute the largest individual source of copper to the marine environment and shipping accounts for more than one third of the total copper input to the area. Ongoing research at Chalmers University of Technology is showing that nontoxic antifouling paints can be at least as efficient as copper paints, yet it takes time to change the current practices within the shipping industry.
                        Another major vector for spreading of alien or non-indigenous species is <b>Ballast water</b> that is used to stabilize a ship when it is sailing with empty cargo holds. In line with the global Ballast Water Management Convention that entered into force in 2017, large ships sailing between different countries must use a treatment system, to minimize spreading of invasive, non-indigenous species. However, some of the common treatment systems used unintentionally produce toxic and persistent disinfection byproducts. This is an emerging concern that needs further investigation.
                        While many of the onboard systems giving rise to environmental pressures are related to the operation and propulsion of the ship, also the people onboard, crew and passengers, give rise to waste. Black water or sewage, and grey water from sinks, shower, laundry and kitchen are mixtures of organic matter, nutrients and cleaning agents. Following decades of debate, especially on cruise ships’ discharge of sewage, there are today regulations in place with respect to black water, however, grey water is still unregulated, unless it is being mixed with black water prior to discharge. An emerging concern of grey water discharge is the content of microplastics being discharged to the marine environment.
                        Cooling water, just like the strive to reduce marine growth on the outside of the hull, it is important to eliminate growth inside the cooling system, why often toxic metals such as copper and zinc are released in the cooling water. It is of course of vital importance that the engine has proper cooling, otherwise there is a risk of blackouts that may result in severe accidents. However, this should be an area of possible innovation to develop new techniques that prevent growth in the cooling system without active release of toxic substances. To stimulate such a development, maybe there is a need for regulation – today cooling water is not regulated.
                        The insight that ship emissions are possible to regulate is important. One prominent example of possible significant reduction of ship related contaminants is the restriction of the exhaust gas treatment systems known as scrubbers. In 2020, new global legislation entered into force, limiting the maximum allowed sulfur content in marine fuels. The aim was to reduce air pollution and the resulting acid rain from ship exhausts. However, there are strong economic incentives for shipowners to continue using the cheap, dirty heavy fuel oil. There are also strong incentives for the oil industry to maintain the shipping industry as their offset market for the residual product from the refining process. By installing a scrubber, ships can continue to use heavy fuel oil, and a fine spray of seawater is used to wash the ship exhausts, to reduce the emissions of acidifying sulfur oxides to the atmosphere. Unfortunately, also other pollutants are washed out and the scrubber effluent is a rather potent mixture of metals, organic contaminants.  Typically a medium sized ship can discharge 1000 cubic meters of scrubber effluent per hour, twentyfour-seven, all year round, of heavily contaminated water at pH3. Since 2018 the number of ships equipped with scrubbers have increased from a handful to more than 6000 globally. Together these ships consume more than 25% of the global bunker oil consumed by the international fleet.
                        Another mixture being discharged from ships is bilge water, primarily condense water from the engine room, with cleaning agents and residuals of fuel oil and lubricants.
                        Most ships use oil for propeller shaft lubrication, which implies a constant leakage of these oils that often are more toxic than fuel oils.
                        From the atmosphere, we also have indirect deposition of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, along with particulate matter. The amounts of pollutants and atmospheric deposition stand for more than 99% of the total nitrogen input from shipping.
                        Finally, there is also some solid waste, such as food waste that is allowed to grind and throw overboard.
                        Then, emerging areas of interest are illumination, i.e. artificial light pollution, and although wake wash giving rise to coastal erosion is rather well-studied, the turbulent wake is understudied. Recent research at Chalmers University of Technology shows that the turbulent wake can remain different from the surrounding water for up to 30 minutes after a ship has passed. This gives rise to questions on how the connectivity in the marine ecosystem may be affected especially by intensively trafficked shipping lanes. Illumination, wake wash, and the turbulent wake are all examples of energy pollution. Another such example is underwater radiated noise, primarily originating from propeller cavitation. Underwater noise is challenging to regulate, but there are ongoing efforts both to design more silent ships, and to identify thresholds of maximum allowed noise in different marine environments.

                        This was an overview of the most common types of pressures and impacts caused by commercial shipping today. To conclude, many of the aforementioned subsystems are regulated individually, primarily through by the International Maritime Organization. However, if we look at it from an environmental management perspective, we can see that many of the subsystems contain the same sort of stressors, for example copper in antifouling paints, cooling water and scrubber effluent, but they are not assessed in a holistic way by the shipping regulations. This is a knowledge gap that urgently needs to be closed.
                        Stay tuned for our upcoming guided tours on pressures from cruise ships and chemical tankers.

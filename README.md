To run locally, start a static webserver in this directory. If you have python 3, you can type:

Maintain a linear history on the main branch; rebase rather than merging:
```bash
git pull --rebase
```

Smaller changes can be pushed directly to `main`, but larger features that involves other developers should have their separate feature branch and a pull request.

```bash
git checkout -b new-feature
git add <some-file>
git commit
git push -u origin new-feature
```

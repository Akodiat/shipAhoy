        <p>
            Ballast water is used to ensure vessels stability and optimal vessel trim. Ballast water is pumped into ballast tanks when a ship has delivered cargo to a port and is departing with less cargo or no cargo. Ballast water is then transported and released at the next port-of-call where the ship picks up more cargo. When a ship is receiving or delivering cargo to a number of ports, it may release or take on a portion of ballast water at each port and the ship’s ballast water can contain a mix of waters from multiple ports.

            Ballast water discharge has been identified as a main vector in spreading of invasive species.

            The recent global requirements to treat the water at ballasting and/or de-ballasting can contribute to contaminant load of (often halogenated) disinfection by-products.

            Scrubbers are installed on ships to enable the vessel to continue to run on conventional high sulfur fuels while still being compliant to stricter regulations limiting the sulfur oxide content in shipss exhaust. In a scrubber, water is sprayed over the exhaust, reducing the concentration of SOx in the exhaust to compliant levels. The scrubber water is not only taking upp SOx, forming sulfuric acid and becoming highly acidic, but also scavenges other contaminants (e.g. metals and organic substances) that are instead discharged directly to the marine environment.

            The use of scrubbers introduces a new contamination source to the marine environment with substantial adverse effects on marine organisms at very low concentrations.

        <p>
            The majority of today's commercial fleet are still running on conventional fossil bunker fuels where heavy fuel oil (HFO), marine gas oil (MGO) and hybrid fuels (very low sulpfur fuel oils (VLSFO) and ultra-low sulfur fuel oils (ULSFO) holds >99% of the fuel market share of the operating fleet (see bar chart below, noting the non-linear scale).
        </p>
        <p>
            The exhaust gas from conventional combustion constitutes of greenhouse gases (e.g. carboon dioxide, nitrous oxide and water), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particles (PM) consisting of soot/black carbon (including non-volatile organic substances) and ash (containing metals).
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition of emitting greenhouse gases, where the commercial shipping fleet are estimated to account for almost 3% of the global CO2 emissions, the combustion products can contribute to acidification (CO2 and SOx), premature deaths from respiratory diseases (e.g. PM) and long- and short-range spreading of hazardous substances (e.g. metals and organic substances).
        </p>
        <p>
            Some measures have been taken to reduce the negative impact of exhaust gases on air quality and human health, including the introduction of alternative fuels (e.g. methanol and LNG), selective catalytic reduction to reduce NOx and scrubbers to reduce SOx. However, the use of scrubbers has resulted in increased pressure on the marine environment and higher climate footprint (see <a onclick="selectAnnotationByName('Scrubber water')">Scrubber water</a>).

            Underwater noise is considered a type of energy pollution. An overview of ship generated underwater noise, and the resulting environmental impacts was published by EMSA in 2022 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.emsa.europa.eu/protecting-the-marine-environment/underwater-noise/download/6881/4503/23.html">[1]</a>.

            “In 2014, the International Maritime Organization approved voluntary guidelines for reducing underwater noise from commercial ships <a target="_blank" href="www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/HotTopics/Pages/Noise.aspx">[2]</a>. These guidelines focused on design features that could reduce the primary sources of underwater noise, namely the propellers, hull form, and on-board machinery. Following these guidelines, in 2015, Maersk underwent a retrofit of five large container ships and found that reducing propeller cavitation decreased low-frequency sound pressure levels by 6 to 8 dB while improving fuel efficiency.” <a target="_blank" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba4658">[3]</a>
